Bitcoin Network Longevity Summit

Intro

We want an easy button for companies in our industry to press to fund things in bitcoin development in our ecosystem. Over the past several years, Bitcoin Core development has funded in different ways. It used to be that the people who were whales, miners and developers were the same people. But then, miners and developers diverged. When miners and developers diverged, there were issues that emerged. Post COVID, it seems like that a lot of the long-time core developers have merged off in a different direction. We have a handful of strong developers who have been comimtting their lives to make sure bitcoin succeeds, but also some younger newer folks who are dedicated to bitcoin but haven't been around too long. But we have about 40 core developers right now, which is probably not enough. There's really no long-term funding solution. When we talk about core development, we're not talking about Hanson, runes, ordinals or whatever, or layer 2. We are talking about security code and bugs in the primary function of bitcoin. We're not talking about any new stuff-- we're talking about the folks who are doing the primary code for Bitcoin Core. We'll talk about why that is important today, and ultimately come away with ways that a CEO of a public company can say they can participate, or a banker, or an exchange, or a pool. What are some easy ways for those people to help fund Bitcoin Core development or provide resources? This is the third grouping of this group. We want to come away with some possible solutions that we can offer to the industry. We want other companies in the space to be able to participate. Thanks everyone for coming.
