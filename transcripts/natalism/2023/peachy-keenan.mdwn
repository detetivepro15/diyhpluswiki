Hi everybody. I am a contributing editor to the American Mind and I have a book called Domestic Extremists. I am also a convert to Catholicism from secular nothingness and liberal feminism. Finally, I identify to husband-sexual which means I am only attracted to people who are my husband. So far that's only one person.

Most of the hard-core natalists are too busy to come. Who has the most children in the room? Pat has 8 kids. Oh, only 7 over there. Congratulations on 7. There are a lot of reasons why people aren't beating the replacement rate.

One reason is that expressing your fertility has become taboo. The big family brand has lost its luster. The big family brand has been hurt by TV families like the Octomom and these other circus freaks. Having too many kids has been branded the modern day equivalent of the lobotomy.

Natalism has been left only for the hicks and the religious fanatics. Deep down there seems to be something incredibly alluring and romantic about the big American family. That's what my book Domestic Extremists is about. Unless you're threatened by monogomist breeding pairs, the book is not threatening. It prioritizes family formation.

Tradmoms like me are treated as domestic extremists by modern culture and our government. I am not talking about returning to the middle ages or the colonial era. We don't have to go back that far in time to a time when culture wasn't so hostile to big families. I mean just as recently as 1980s.

The McAlisters have 5 kids. The uncle has 4 kids. The uncle who lives in Paris has 5. That's 14 kids in that family. John Hughes was a sneaky reactionary... the movie is so good, nobody realizes it is a love letter to traditional natalism. The McAlisters have a dreamy life and dreamy house even when they are leaving Kevin home by accident. Deep down we all want to be Kevin. They want the big family to drive back to us and rescue us from being loneliness.

In real life, anti-natalists are the enemy. Remember how Sarah Pailin was wrecked for having 5 kids? She was reduced to an object of scorn and division for having too many kids and worst of all failed to abort the one with a genetic disorder. You know who else has 5 kids? Nancy Pelosi. You never hear a word about that.

Like them, I also have 5 children. I never thought about natalism. I grew up in Los Angeles as 1 of 3 kids which was a standard number for the boomer parents in my neighborhood. When I thought about my future, I thought about kids sure but not yet. Maybe in the future. Our goal was to avoid pregnancy in our 20s.

I wanted to have some kids but not too many. I was way too cool to have some big messy family. I didn't want to have to buy a shipping container size of corn flakes and I didn't want kids that all had names with the same starting letter.

And then I started having babies and these guys were cute. When it came to newborns, I was a newbie. I knew that I had to move fast since I started late. I had 5 kids in 10 years. One at a time, the old fashion way. No reproductive technology. No egg freezing. No IVF. The french have an expression for this: "fucking your husband". Coitus is a natural, zesty enterprise.

My oldest is now a high school senior and my baby is in 2nd grade. Every day I wish that I had one more extra. But I aged out. Sometimes having a bunc hof kids in Los Angeles it can be a bummer. I get comments like "oh, sorry" and "oh, you know there are ways to prevent that these days".

When I was pregnant with my 3rd, my neighbor sneered at me and asked if I was a mormon. Can you believe that?

When I was pregnant with my 5th, a collegaue asked me why I didn't abort this one. She was genuinely curious! Nobody could understand what I was up to. Why would any person in their right mind keep going past 1 or 2?

But sometimes I get to own a child-free libtard in real time. I will see some wine-o at Trader's Joe feminist someone with an NPR tote bag and she asks "oh is she your only one?". I try not to rub my hands when this happens. When I tell them I have 5, their face expresses horror.

The most pushback I get is from normies with 2 kids. They decided long ago that 2 is the right number. Your very existence with 5 calls them into question. The peer pressure to keep your family small these days is crushing. Young couples live in fear of enraging the anti-natalist tyrants.

There seems to be something primal and sort of threatening about a woman who has too many kids. This is the vibe I get from women who chose differently. Does my refusal to stop at 2 make them reconsider them getting their tubes tied? Is it a reminder that they could have kept going? Or do they think I am chained to the oven by a domineering husband? People like this react with panic and try to talk you out of having more.

After I had my 4th child, everyone asked me "you're done, right?". They needed me to be done having kids. I would always answer, no not yet, I love having more. They would screech.

But we could use their visceral hatred of big families to our advantage. The other side is not reproducing. The anti-natalists are sterilizing themselves. They get on the pill at 14 and stay on it past 40 years old. They sterilize their own kids with puberty blockers and wipe out their own chance at grandkids. Imagine fighting a war where the ohter side are shooting themselves.

This is our opportunity to seize the means of reproduction. This opportunity will not last forever. It's not like the people aligned with us are having tons of kids either. Pro-natalists have the same low birth rates as the other side. Even now the people walking the walk are the trads, the real ones not the ones on tiktoks, and the religious.

Their attitudes are "I will have as many kids as happens". They have leaned all the way into natalism. We won't be where we need to be if we wait for all the trads and Elon Musk to repopulate the country. A tiny fringe of smart competent people having 4 or 5 kids is going to take too long. It doesn't scale fast enough. We need to scale faster and get to 10x.

((What we need is the human gigafactory. Look it up.))

We send our kids to a tradcath school. Some of the other families there need 8 or 9 kids. The big brains in this room need to figure out how to market big families and natalism to the girl bosses and midwits. Having a big family needs to be re-branded not as something that the very religious and the very rich can do, but an aspirational living your best life for more women.

But we need to be careful. We don't want to market natalism to the progressive feminists. We need to max out fertility to people who won't raise children who are going to be gender neutral furries or whatever. The fear of climate change will keep liberal birth rates low forever. Thank you Greta.

The only way forward is to make motherhood a must have and to make siblings a status symbol and make children a hotly desirable currency. This trend is already starting, as with others it is starting with celebrities. Our job is to make motherhood great again. We need to seduce more high quality uterus havers into starting their own great American dynasties.

There are lots of obstacles like everyone is too fat, too poor, too addictive, too online, etc. In Austin, there is still enough healthy looking fertile looking candidates to take up this position. We need to push the people off e-bike sand into minivans full of toddlers. People are going to realize they are tired of being home alone with their cats when Taylor Swift gets pregnant. The road ahead is clear. We start the war from here.

To those who think that becoming domesticly extreme is out of reach and is a luxury lifestyle, don't reject it. Go to war with the ovaries you got. "Courage, do not fall back. In a little, the place wil be yours. Watch. When the wind blows, my banner against the bullwork. You shall take it."
