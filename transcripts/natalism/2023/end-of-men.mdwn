The end of men (and women)?

Raw Egg Nationalist

I am going to be talking about the fertility crisis. You should be treating this with the upmost seriousness and existential seriousness. Just as importantly, you will know how to protect yourself against the problem as best as you can.

The first thing you can do is if you bring a plastic water bottle to the conference, don't drink it. You'll find out why.

Josh "Salsa Fiend" Vandiver... the great replacement.. no doubt he is preparing an extremely flattering writeup of this conference for a newspaper or his personal tumbler that he maintains with his husband, a Venezuelan salsa dancer. I'm sure the piece will make for a fascinating jargon free read which will help bring people together during these troubling times. We don't need another hit piece stirring up anxieties about alt-right or Christian nationalists. To everyone else in attendance, I would like to issue a plea: make Josh feel as welcome and comfortable and most of all as safe as it is possible for him to feel safe. .... Keep him alive and in good health at all costs.

Over the course of today and tomorrow, you will hear about factors depressing fertility and stopping people from having children. Some will be social, economic, political, or biological. Others will be less so.

I will talk about one factor you might not be familiar with: endocrine disruptors.

The Scythians dealt with fertility issues from a life on hourse back. Pseudo-Hippocrates argued the Scythians cannot be prolific because women spent long periods overweight in wheeled wagons, and the hardness of the saddles damaged the male reproductive organs and the men wear tight trousers. Tight clothing and saddles are devastating for fertility. Often these people were completely sterile until finding a less strenuous job.
